# Libasm
> *The aim of this project is to get familiar with assembly language.*

*An assembly (or assembler) language, often abbreviated asm, is a low-level programming language for a computer, or other programmable device, in which there is a very strong (but often not one-to-one) correspondence between the language and the architectureâ€™s machine code instructions.*
*Each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture.*
*In contrast, most high-level programming languages are generally portable across multiple architectures but require interpreting or compiling.*
*Assembly language may also be called symbolic machine code.*
